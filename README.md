# Delavan_Lake_visitors_insight

Project/Problem

Delavan Lake is a Hydrologic Drainage lake located in Walworth County, Wisconsin. According to the Department of Natural Resources, the lake area encompasses 1,906 acres, with a maximum depth of 52 feet and an average depth of 21 feet. The lake supports various recreational activities including boating, swimming, Bass and Walleye fishing, as well as Ice Fishing, and Snowmobiling during the winter months. With the water quality of the lake in recent years deteriorating, it is clear more monitorization, maintenance, and possible rehabilitation efforts may be necessary for the lake’s environmental status. The purpose of this report is to analyze how improving the water quality may incentivize existing visitors to spend more time in Delavan and benefit the local economy of the area. In order to help analyze this task, we administered a number of surveys to Delavan Lake residents with the intent of getting an insight into their recreational tendencies and spending patterns. The results show that out of many factors, environmental quality is an important one, and may lead to economic growth with quality improvement.

Data

My team posted surveys by mail to residents who lived either directly or within close proximity to the Delavan Lake. These surveys were sent to residents who live on the lake year-round, as well as residents who live throughout Wisconsin and Illinois that reside near the lake temporarily throughout the year. 
The Survey included various questions about both the individual taking the survey and their household. The collected data through the responses is summarized and analyzed by my team.

Methodology 

The data collected through the survey was used to conduct statistical analysis to predict which variables affect the likeliness of an individual that is willing to visit Delavan Lake more often. We use predictive models such as Classification and Regression Trees (CART) along with different Regression models such as linear and logistic regression models in our analysis. In this report, we interpreted the significant findings from these models. Using the results from these statistical models, we can make an educated inference which suggests that the individuals who would spend more time in Delavan if the water quality improved:
•	believe that the current quality of water is poor
•	bought their respective property because appreciation (value) is important to them
•	bought their respective property with retirement as one of the most important reasons
•	spend more on watercraft maintenance and or repair on average

The findings helped the Lake Delavan comittee in focusing their efforts towards the visitors that find the lake water to be unacceptable. By doing so, they are able to drive a larger number of visitors for a longer period of time which induce economic benefits to the areas surrounding the Lake.
